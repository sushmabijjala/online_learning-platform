                DSA is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics – 
                Data Structure and Algorithms. DSA is one of the most important skills that
                 every computer science student must-have. It is often seen that people with
                  good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and 
                  thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant.

                GitHub is a web-based version control and collaboration platform for software developers.
                 Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, acquired the platform for $7.5 billion 
                 in 2018. GitHub, which is delivered through a software as a service (SaaS) business model, 
                 was started in 2008. It was founded on Git, an open source code management system created by
                  Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.

                Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history 
                of all changes to that code. It lets developers collaborate on a project more effectively
                 by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers.

                
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories
                 for free, but it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans. Each public
                  and private repository contains all of a project's files, as well as each file's revision 
                  history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

                Front-end development is the development of visual and interactive elements of a website that 
                users interact with directly. It's a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where HTML provides
                 the structure, CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic behaviour and interactivity.

                As a front-end developer, you'll be responsible for creating the user interface of a website, 
                to ensure it looks good and is easy to use, with great focus on design principles and user 
                experience. You'll be working closely with designers, back-end developers, and project managers
                to make sure the final product meets the client's needs and provides the best possible experience
                for the end-users.

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                Front-end developers are also known as front-end engineers, front-end web developers, 
                JavaScript Developers, HTML/CSS Developer, front-end web designers, and front-end web architects.
                Each of these roles mostly encompass the same front-end development skills but require different 
                levels of expertise in different front-end development skills. It's better to look at the job
                 description to get an idea about the job requirements.

                Android software development is the process by which applications are created for devices running the Android operating system. Google states that[3] "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages" using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also possible. All non-Java virtual machine (JVM) languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming languages and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and iOS). Third party tools, development environments, and language support have also continued to evolve and expand since the initial SDK was released in 2008. The official Android app distribution mechanism to end users is Google Play; it also allows staged gradual app release, as well as distribution of pre-release app versions to testers.

                Artificial intelligence (AI) generally refers to processes and algorithms that are able to simulate human intelligence, including mimicking cognitive functions such as perception, learning and problem solving. Machine learning and deep learning (DL) are subsets of AI.

                Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, providing access to shared resources such as storage, servers, databases, software, and other computing capabilities. Instead of relying on local infrastructure and physical servers, cloud computing allows organizations and individuals to leverage virtual resources that are scalable, flexible, and accessible from anywhere.

            <br>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                Cloud computing has a rich history that extends back to the 1960s, with the initial concepts of time-sharing becoming popularized via Remote Job Entry (RJE). The "data center" model, where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era. This was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing, optimizing the infrastructure, platform, and applications, and increasing efficiency for end users
